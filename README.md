Midi Host

## Software synth for USB Midi keyboards

Plug in a USB Midi keyboard and play it. No settings, no distractions.

Supports legacy devices that the Marshmallow Midi API doesn't. All the heavy lifting is done by two great libraries,
[kshoji/USB-MIDI-Driver](https://github.com/kshoji/USB-MIDI-Driver) for communication with the device and
[billthefarmer/mididriver](https://github.com/billthefarmer/mididriver) for sound generation.
